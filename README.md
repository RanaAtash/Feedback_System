# Feedback_System
This project aims to design a feedback system between two servo motors. The Analog Feedback servo motor was replaced by a normal servo motor that performs the same function. The process works by feeding back the reading of the first motor potentiometer to the microcontroller where it is saved inside the EEPROM. Then, this value is fed to the second servo motor resulting in an identical movement for the two motors. Due to the use of Tinkercad simulator, the first motor was replaced by a potentiometer and its reading was mapped to an angle of rotation for the motor.
